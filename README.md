Created in 2013, it's a website based on a social network idea with a purpose of connecting people specifically about car rides.
At the time, we took a similar concept from Uber, which was not yet in Brazil, and the final product was intended to provide a way with which people could offer rides (priced or not) and accept rides, all the user had to do was post his / her intention and then chat with the interested ones, over a comment system or even using the chat itself. At the end, it became a prototype, since it was developed as a final project in the Information Systems Technician Course at COTEMIG (Colégio Técnico de Minas Gerais).

It was made using PHP, MySQL and HTML, CSS, JavaScript technologies, basically.

The files are organized as follows:
- the "Controller" folder contains the codes of PHP classes, that use the database to retrieve data;
- the "Model" folder contains the PHP class for connecting to the database and an example of the structure (Tables, Storage Prcedures, Triggers and Data itself) used for testing the system;
- CSS and JavaScript files can be found at the corresponding folders;
- the ohter PHP files are used for linking the system, so they are in root;

Everithing was made very simple and maybe not so professional or organized :|

Ah, in case you wondered, the name means something like "Project Come Together" :D
